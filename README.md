# TimeWeightDAO: Dynamic Time-Weighted Governance System

TimeWeightDAO is a Clarity smart contract that implements a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with a dynamic time-weighted governance system. In this system, voting power scales with the duration of token holding, encouraging long-term participation and alignment of interests.

## Features

1. **Time-Weighted Voting Power**: Users' voting power increases based on how long they've held their tokens, up to a maximum multiplier.
2. **Token Deposits and Withdrawals**: Users can deposit and withdraw governance tokens.
3. **Proposal Creation and Voting**: Users can create proposals and vote on them.
4. **Automatic Proposal Execution**: Proposals can be executed after the voting period if they meet the quorum threshold.
5. **Safety Mechanisms**: Various checks and balances to ensure the integrity of the governance process.

## Key Components

- **Governance Token**: An SIP-010 compliant token used for voting.
- **Proposals**: Structured data representing governance proposals.
- **Token Deposits**: Tracking of user token deposits and deposit times.
- **User Votes**: Recording of user votes on proposals.

## Constants

- `VOTING_PERIOD`: Duration of the voting period (144 blocks, ~24 hours).
- `MIN_PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD`: Minimum tokens needed to create a proposal (100,000,000).
- `POWER_MULTIPLIER`: Base multiplier for voting power calculations (100).
- `MAX_HOLDING_BONUS`: Maximum voting power multiplier (3x).
- `QUORUM_THRESHOLD`: Minimum total votes required for a proposal to pass (500,000,000).

## Main Functions

1. `set-governance-token`: Set the governance token for the DAO.
2. `deposit-tokens`: Deposit governance tokens into the DAO.
3. `withdraw-tokens`: Withdraw governance tokens from the DAO.
4. `create-proposal`: Create a new governance proposal.
5. `vote`: Vote on an active proposal.
6. `execute-proposal`: Execute a proposal after the voting period ends.

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract to a Stacks blockchain.
2. Set the governance token using `set-governance-token`.
3. Users can deposit tokens using `deposit-tokens`.
4. Create proposals using `create-proposal`.
5. Vote on proposals using `vote`.
6. After the voting period, execute proposals using `execute-proposal`.

## Error Handling

The contract includes various error codes to handle different scenarios, such as unauthorized access, invalid proposals, and insufficient balances. These ensure the robustness and security of the governance system.

## Security Considerations

- The contract owner has the authority to set the governance token.
- Proposals have a minimum threshold to prevent spam.
- Voting power is capped to prevent excessive influence by long-term holders.
- Quorum threshold ensures sufficient participation for proposal execution.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a proposal queue system for orderly execution.
2. Add support for different types of proposals (e.g., parameter changes, fund allocations).
3. Implement a timelock mechanism for sensitive operations.
4. Add events for better off-chain tracking of DAO activities.

This smart contract is provided as-is. Users and implementers should thoroughly review and test the contract before use in any production environment.
